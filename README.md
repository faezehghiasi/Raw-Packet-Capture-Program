# Raw Packet Capture Program

## üìã Overview
This repository contains a simple C program that creates a raw socket to capture and display network packets at the data link layer (Layer 2). It identifies and prints details about IP and ARP packets, while displaying the type of packet (outgoing, broadcast, multicast, or incoming).

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Create Raw Socket:** Captures all Ethernet frames passing through the interface.
- **Packet Identification:** Detects and prints details about IP and ARP packets.
- **Packet Type Display:** Shows whether packets are outgoing, broadcast, multicast, or incoming.
- **Hexadecimal Dump:** Displays raw packet data in hexadecimal format for detailed analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Linux Operating System:** Required for raw socket creation.
- **C Compiler:** Recommended compiler is **gcc**.
- **Root Privileges:** Superuser permissions are needed for creating raw sockets.

---

## üîß Building the Code
Use the provided **Makefile** to compile the program.

1. **Open a terminal.**
2. **Navigate** to the project directory containing the Makefile.
3. **Run** the following command to build the program:

```bash
make
```

---

## üíª Usage
Run the compiled program with **root privileges**:

```bash
sudo ./packet_capture
```

The program will begin capturing packets and printing their details to the console. Use **Ctrl+C** to stop the program.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Use this program **only** for educational or authorized network analysis.
- Ensure network interface permissions are configured properly.
- The program supports basic packet types and can be extended for deeper analysis.
